## Specific Typefaces

### Slope Gothic

The Slope Gothic I'm interested in is the one used for street name
legends on USGS topographic maps from the 1950s to the 1980s.

-   [This USGS type book](https://pubs.usgs.gov/unnumbered/70194715/report.pdf)
    includes Slope Gothic which I believe is that same font.
